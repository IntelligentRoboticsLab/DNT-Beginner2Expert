    "All data types are defined as objects or classes. Classes store information and certain associated functions. Classes are a usefull structure for structuring programms and keeping you information ordered and stored in clear way. Lets define a simple class ourselves, this can be done using the **class** keyword. The information we store in a class are called its properties or attributes. Making use of this model of using classes that have atrributes and associated functions is referred to as object oriented programming or OOP for short. In this case our car class has one attribute, color, which stores the color of the car. Usually, in python you define classes with a PascalCase naming convention. This means they start with a capitol and each new word in the name also starts with a capitol. If you want to learn more about different naming conventions take a look [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_convention_(programming))."

In this case the \\_\\_init\\_\\_(), function is associated with the class Car. The second thing that might be new is the self keyword that is provided as the fist argument to the \\_\\_init\\_\\_() function. This is a variable that can now be used within that function to acces the attributes of the object. In this case it is used to set the attribute color to be the same as provided argument to the color parameter. The last thing that is new is the usage of the two underscores around the function name.
