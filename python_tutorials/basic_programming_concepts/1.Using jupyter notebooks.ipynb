    "A jupyter notebook consists of two type of cells. Markdown cells and code cells. This is a markdown cell and can be used to document the code supporting. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. In jupyter notebooks it supports usefull features like latex for writing mathematical equations. For more information on markdown syntax you can look [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/). Each cell in a jupyter notebook can be executed by pressing **Ctrl+Enter**. Try executing the code cell below, which you might already be familiar with."

When you use this shortcut, make sure you are not currently editing that cell, you can stop editing a cell by pressing **Esc**. You can also insert a new cell below the current cell by using the shortcut **b**. To edit a cell you can simply click on it or press **Enter** when it is selected."
