    "We have already learned that python is an intepreted language. How does this work in pratice? The interpreteritself is, just like the code you write yourself, also a program. Many different interpreters for python code have been written in different languages. The interpreter that is usually used, is the cpython implementation and is a python interpreter written in c. So what happens when this program interprets our code? Before it interprets the code you have written, it first compiles that code down to a language that is more easily readable by computers, reffered to as bytecode. To learn more about the entire process of compilation of python code take a look [here](https://leanpub.com/insidethepythonvirtualmachine/read#leanpub-auto-allocating-frame-objects)"

For a deeper dive into python bytecode, take a look [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-python-bytecode-e7edaae8734d). The PVM interprets the byte code and converts it into machine code that can be executed on the CPU."

Memory management is the process of efficiently allocating, de-allocating, and coordinating memory so that all the different processes run smoothly and can optimally access different system resources. Memory management also involves cleaning memory of objects that are no longer being accessed. So lets talk a little bit about how variables and different classes are stored in memory. Read [this](https://realpython.com/python-memory-management/) article to learn more about this topic. "
