    "All data types are defined as classes. When classes are instanciated as objects, they store some information and certain associated functions (what this means exactly will become more clear along the way). Objects are a usefull structure for structuring programms and keeping you information ordered and stored in clear way. Lets define a simple class ourselves, this can be done using the **class** keyword. The information we store in a class are called its properties or attributes. Making use of this model of using objects that have atrributes and associated functions is referred to as object oriented programming or OOP for short. In this case our car class has one attribute, color, which stores the color of the car. Usually, in python you define classes with a PascalCase naming convention. This means they start with a capitol and each new word in the name also starts with a capitol. If you want to learn more about different naming conventions take a look [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_convention_(programming))."
