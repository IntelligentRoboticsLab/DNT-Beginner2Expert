IT IS A WAY I HAVE OF DRIVING OFF THE SPLEEN AND REGULATING THE CIRCULATION. WHENEVER I FIND MYSELF GROWING GRIM ABOUT THE MOUTH, WHENEVER IT IS A DAMP, DRIZZLY NOVEMBER IN MY SOUL, WHENEVER I FIND MYSELF INVOLUNTARILY PAUSING BEFORE COFFIN WAREHOUSES, AND BRINGING UP THE REAR OF EVERY FUNERAL I MEET, AND ESPECIALLY WHENEVER MY HYPOS GET SUCH AN UPPER HAND OF ME, THAT IT REQUIRES A STRONG MORAL PRINCIPLE TO PREVENT ME FROM DELIBERATELY STEPPING INTO THE STREET, AND METHODICALLY KNOCKING PEOPLES HATS OFF, THEN, I ACCOUNT IT HIGH TIME TO GET TO SEA AS SOON AS I CAN. THIS IS MY SUBSTITUTE FOR PISTOL AND BALL.
